Compile, run and compare outputs of old and improved gaussian on different matrix sizes 16,1024,4096 supported
./compileAndCompare.sh [size]

Run program some number of times for some matrix and get average times
./benchmark.sh [matrix_size] [number_of_runs] [program]
    Matrix size can be 16, 1024, or 4096.
    Number of runs can be 10, 25, or 50.
    Program will default to impGaussian/gaussian

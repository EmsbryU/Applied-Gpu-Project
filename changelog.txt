Modifications done:
Removed deprecated and unnecessary cudaThreadSynchronise()
New fan functions (changed where b is calculated to Fan1 -  less branching)
New dynamic grid dimensions
New timing library
Combined the two fan functions into one (seems to be little bit slower)
Created gaussian2.cu where multiplier matrix is smaller (less mem to copy)
